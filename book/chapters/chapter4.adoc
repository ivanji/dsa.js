= Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is one of the most common solutions when we want to extract some insights about a collection of data.
We can sort to get the maximum or minimun value and many algorithmic problems involves sorting data first.

Before we dive into the most well-known sorting algorithms, let's discuess about the sorting properties.
