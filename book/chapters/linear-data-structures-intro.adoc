Data Structures comes in many flavors. Thereâ€™s no one to rule them all. There are tradeoffs for each one of them. Even thought in your day-to-day, you might not need to re-implementing them, knowing how they work internally would help you choose the right tool for the job. We are going to explore the most common data structures time and space complexity.

.In this part we are going to learn about the following linear data structures:
-	Array
-	Linked List
-	Stack
-	Queue

Later, in the next part we are going to explore non-linear data structures like Graphs and Trees.
