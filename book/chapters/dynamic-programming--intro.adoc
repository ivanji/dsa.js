Dynamic programming (dp) is a way to solve algorithmic problems by finding the base case and building a solution from the ground-up. We also keep track of previous answers to avoid re-computing the same operations.

.How to explain dynamic programming to kids? ðŸ‘¶
----

*Write down 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1*

- What's that equal to?
- *Kid counting* Ten!
- Add another "+1". What's the total now?
- *Quickly*  Eleven!
- Why you get the result so quickly? Ah, you got it faster by adding one to the memorized previous result. So Dynamic Programming is a fancy way of saying: "remembering past results to save time later"
