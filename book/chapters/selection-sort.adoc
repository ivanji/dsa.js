= Selection Sort

The selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. As its name indicates, it chooses the lowest element from the list and move it where it should be.

TIP: Selection sort is a in-place sorting algorithms, it should be used when auxiliary memory is limited.

.Selection sort algorithm
. Start with the element in position 0.
. Find minimum element in the rest of array. If a new minimun is found swap them.
. Repeat with the element in postion 1 and so until the last one.

== Selection sort implementation
For implementing the selection sort we need 2 indexes.

.Selection sort
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/selection-sort.js[tag=sort, indent=0]
----

One index is for the position in question (selection/outer) and another one for finding the minimun in the rest of the array (element/inner).

The swap function is implemented as follows.

.Swap function
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/sorting-common.js[tag=swap, indent=0]
----

It uses JavaScript ES6 destructing arrays.

.JavaScript Array destructuring
****
*Assignment separate from declaration*

A variable can be assign to its values using the destructing syntax.

[source, javascript]
----
let a, b;

[a, b] = [1, 2];
console.log(a); //↪️ 1
console.log(b); //️↪️ 2
----

*Swapping variables*

Two variables values can be swapped in one destructuring expression.

[source, javascript]
----
[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); //↪️ 2
console.log(b); //️↪️ 1
----

Without destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable.
