Divide and conquer is another strategy for solving algorithmic problems.
It splits the input into manageble parts recursively and finally join solved pieces to form the end result.

.Examples of divide and conquer algorithms:
- <<Merge Sort>>: *divides* the input into pairs, sort them and them *join* all the pieces in ascending order.
- <<Quicksort>>: *splits* the data by a random number called "pivot", then move everything smaller than the pivot to the left and anything bigger to the right. Repeat the process on the left and right side. Note: since this works in place doesn't need a join part.
- <<logarithmic-example, Binary Search>>: find a value in a sorted collection by *spliting* the data in half until it finds the value.
- <<Getting all permutations of a word, Permutations>>: *Take out* the first element from the input and solve permutation for the reminder of the data recursively, then *join* results and append the elements that were take out.

We can solve algorithms using D&C algorithms using the following steps.

.Divide and conquer algorithms steps:
1. *Divide* data into subproblems.
2. *Conquer* each subproblem.
3. *Combine* solutions.
