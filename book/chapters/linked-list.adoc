= Linked List

A list (or Linked List) is a linear data structure where each node is linked to another one.

Linked Lists can be:
- Singly: every item has a pointer to the next node
- Doubly: every node has a reference to the next and previous object
- Circular: the last element points to the first one.
We are going to explore the first two in the next sections.

== Singly Linked List

Each element or node is *linked* to the next one by a reference. When a node only has the reference to the next element, it's called *singly linked list*:

Usually, a Linked List is referenced by the first element in called *head* (or *root* node). For instance, if you want to get the `cat` element from the example above, then the only way to get there is using the next field on the head node. You would get `art` first, then use the next field recursively until you eventually get the `cat` element.

== Doubly Linked List

When each node has a reference to the next item and also the previous one, then we have a *doubly linked list*.

If we implement the code for the `Node` elements, it would be something like this:

== Linked List vs. Array

Arrays allow you to access data anywhere in the collection using an index. However, Linked List visits nodes in sequential order. In the worst case scenario, it takes _O(n)_ to get an element from a Linked List. You might be wondering: Isn’t always an array more efficient with O(1) access time? It depends.

We also have to understand the space complexity to see the trade-offs between arrays and linked lists. An array pre-allocates contiguous blocks of memory. When the array is getting full, it has to copy all the elements over to a new space usually 2x bigger.  It takes _O(n)_ to copy all the items over. On the other hand, LinkedList’s nodes only reserve precisely the amount of memory it needs. They don’t have to be next to each other, nor large chunks of memory have to be booked beforehand like arrays. Linked List is more on a "grow as you go" basis.

Another difference is that adding/deleting at the beginning on an array takes O(n), however, in the linked list is a constant operation O(1) as we will implement later.

A drawback of a linked list is that if you want to insert/delete an element at the end of the list, you would have to navigate the whole collection to find the last one O(n). However, this can be solved by keeping track of the last element in the list. We are going to implement that!

== Implementing a Linked List

We are going to implement a doubly linked list. First, let's start with the constructor.

// image:image22.png[image,width=528,height=251]

.Linked List's constructor
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=constructor]

  // ... methods go here ...
}
----

In our constructor, we keep a reference of the first (and last node for performance reasons).

== Searching by value

Finding an element by value there’s no other way than iterating through the whole list.

.Linked List's searching by values
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=searchByValue, indent=0]
----

If we find the element, we will return the index otherwise `undefined`. The runtime for locating an item by value is _O(n)_.

For finding elements by value or position we are using the following helper function:
.Find elements using a callback
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=find, indent=0]
----
<1> We initialize two variables `current` to the first node and `position` to keep track of the index.
<2> While `current` node is not null we keep going.
<3> On each loop we move to the next node and increment the index.
<4> We invoke the callback passing the current position and node. If the callback returns something, then we stop and return that value.
<5> Return whatever result we got from the callback. E.g., we can return the index or the node itself or any other calculation.

We are going to use this `find` method again to implement searching by index.

== Searching by index

Searching by index is very similar, we iterate through the list until we find the element that matches the position.

.Linked List's searching by index (position)
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=searchByIndex, indent=0]
----

If there’s no match, we return `undefined` then. The runtime is _O(n)_. As you might notice the search by index and by position methods looks pretty similar. If you want to take a look at the whole implementation https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/7694c20d13f6c53457ee24fbdfd3c0ac57139ff4/src/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js#L8[click here].

== Insertion

Similar to the array, with a linked list you can add elements at the beginning, end or anywhere in the middle of the list. So, let's implement each case.

=== Inserting elements at the beginning of the list

We are going to use the `Node` class to create a new element and stick it at the beginning of the list as shown below.

.Insert at the beginning by linking the new node with the current first node.
image:image23.png[image,width=498,height=217]


To insert at the beginning, we create a new node with the next reference to the current first node. Then we make first the new node. In code, it would look something like this:

[#linked-list-inserting-beginning]

.Add item to the beginning of a Linked List
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=addFirst, indent=0]
----

As you can see, we create a new node and make it the first one.


=== Inserting element at the end of the list

Appending an element at the end of the list can be done very effectively if we have a pointer to the `last` item in the list. Otherwise, you would have to iterate through the whole list.

.Add element to the end of the linked list
image:image24.png[image,width=498,height=208]


In code:

.Linked List's add to the end of the list implementation
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=addLast, indent=0]
----

If there’s no element in the list yet, the first and last node would be the same. If there’s something, then, we go to the `last` item and add the reference `next` to the new node. That’s it! We got a constant time for inserting at the beginning and the end of the list: *O(1)*.


=== Inserting element at the middle of the list

For inserting an element at the middle of the list, you would need to specify the position (index) in the collection. Then, you create the new node and update the references to it.

Let’s do an example, with a doubly linked list. We want to insert the `new` node in the 2^nd^ position.

.Inserting node in the middle of a doubly linked list.
image:image25.png[image,width=528,height=358]

Let’s work in the code to do this:

.Linked List's add to the middle of the list
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=addMiddle, indent=0]
----
<1> If the new item goes to position 0, then we reuse the `addFirst` method, and we are done!
<2> However, If we are adding to the last position, then we reuse the `addLast` method, and done!
<3> Adding `newNode` to the middle: First, create the `new` node only if the position exists. Take a look at <<Searching by index>> to see `get` implementation.
<4> Set newNode `previous` reference.
<5> Set newNode `next` link.
<6> No other node in the list is pointing to `newNode`, so we have to make the prior element point to `newNode`.
<7> Make the next element point to `newNode`.


Take notice that we reused, `addFirst` and `addLast` methods. For all the other cases the insertion is in the middle. We use `current.previous.next` and `current.next.previous` to update the surrounding elements and make them point to the new node. Inserting on the middle takes *O(n)* because we have to iterate through the list using the `get` method.

== Deletion

Deleting is an interesting one. We don’t delete an element; we remove all references to that node. Let’s go case by case to explore what happens.

=== Deleting element from the head

Deleting the first element (or head) is a matter of removing all references to it.

.Deleting an element from the head of the list
image:image26.png[image,width=528,height=74]

For instance, to remove the head (“art”) node, we change the variable `first` to point to the second node “dog”. We also remove the variable `previous` from the "dog" node, so it doesn't point to the “art” node. The garbage collector will get rid of the “art” node when it seems nothing is using it anymore.

In code, it looks like this:

.Linked List's remove from the beginning of the list
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=removeFirst, indent=0]
----

As you can see, when we want to remove the first node we make the 2nd element the first one.

=== Deleting element from the tail

Removing the last element from the list would require to iterate from the head until we find the last one, that’s O(n). But, If we have a reference to the last element, which we do, We can do it in _O(1)_ instead!

.Removing last element from the list using the last reference.
image:image27.png[image,width=528,height=221]


For instance, if we want to remove the last node “cat”. We use the last pointer to avoid iterating through the whole list. We check `last.previous` to get the “dog” node and make it the new `last` and remove its next reference to “cat”. Since nothing is pointing to “cat” then is out of the list and eventually is deleted from memory by the garbage collector.

Let’s code this up like this:

.Linked List's remove from the end of the list
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=removeLast, indent=0]
----


The code is very similar to `removeFirst`, but instead of first we update `last` reference, and instead of nullifying `previous` we nullify its `next` reference.

=== Deleting element from the middle

To remove a node from the middle, we make the surrounding nodes to bypass the one we want to delete.

.Remove the middle node
image:image28.png[image,width=528,height=259]


In the illustration, we are removing the middle node “dog” by making art’s `next` variable to point to cat and cat’s `previous` to be “art” totally bypassing “dog”.

Let’s implement it:

.Linked List's remove from the middle of the list
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js[tag=removeByPosition, indent=0]
----

Notice that we are using the `get` method to get the node at the current position. That method loops through the list until it found the node at the specified location. This iteration has a runtime of _O(n)_.

== Linked List Complexity vs. Array Complexity

So far, we have seen two liner data structures with different use cases. Here’s a summary:


.Big O cheat sheet for Linked List and Array
|===
.2+.^s| Data Structure 2+^s| Searching By 3+^s| Inserting at the 3+^s| Deleting from .2+.^s| Space Complexity
^|_Index/Key_ ^|_Value_ ^|_beginning_ ^|_middle_ ^|_end_ ^|_beginning_ ^|_middle_ ^|_end_
| Array ^|O(1) ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(1) ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(1) ^|O(n)
| Linked List (singly) ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(1) ^|O(n) ^|O(1) ^|O(1) ^|O(n) ^|*O(n)* ^|O(n)
| Linked List (doubly) ^|O(n) ^|O(n) ^|O(1) ^|O(n) ^|O(1) ^|O(1) ^|O(n) ^|*O(1)* ^|O(n)
|===

If you compare the singly linked list vs. doubly linked list, you will notice that the main difference is deleting elements from the end. For a singly list is *O(n)*, while for a doubly list is *O(1)*.

Comparing an array with a doubly linked list, both have different use cases:

Use arrays when:

* You want to access *random* elements by numeric key or index in constant time O(1).
* You need two-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

Use a doubly linked list when:

* You want to access elements in a *sequential* manner only like <<Stack>> or <<Queue>>.

* You want to insert elements at the start and end of the list. The linked list has O(1) while array has O(n).
* You want to save some memory when dealing with possibly large data sets. Arrays pre-allocate a large chunk of contiguous memory on initialization. Lists are more “grow as you go”.

For the next two linear data structures <<Stack>> and <<Queue>>, we are going to use a doubly linked list to implement them. We could use an array as well, but since inserting/deleting from the start perform better on linked-list, we are going use that.
