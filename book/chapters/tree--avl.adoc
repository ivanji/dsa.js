= AVL Tree

AVL Tree is named after their inventors (**A**delson-**V**elsky and **L**andis).
This self-balancing tree keep track of subtree sizes to know if a rebalance is needed or not.
We can compare the size of the left and right subtrees using a balance factor.

[NOTE]
====

The *balanced factor* on each node is calculated recurviely as follows:

----
Balance Factor = (left subtree height) - (right subtree height)
----

====

The implementation will got into the BST node.
We will need two methods to calculate the left and right subtree, and with those we can get the balance factor.

== Implementing AVL Tree

Implementing an AVL Tree is not too hard, since it builds upon what we did in the Binary Search Tree.

As you can see, AVL tree inherits from the BST class.
The insert and remove operations works the same as in the BST, except that at the end we call `balanceUptream`.
This function makes balance the tree after every change if is needed. Let's see how it's implemented.

This function recurively goes from the modified node to the root checking if each node in between is balanced.
Now, let's examine how does the balancing works on AVL tree.

The first thing we do is to see if one subtree is longer than the other.
If so, then we check the children balance to determine if need a single or double rotation and in which direction.

You can review <<Tree Rotations>> in case you want a refresher.
