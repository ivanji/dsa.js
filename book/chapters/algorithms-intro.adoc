In this part of the book, we are going to cover algorithms in more details. We will provide algorithmic tools for classic problems that will help you improve your problem-solving skills.


IMPORTANT: There's not a single approach to solve all problems but knowing well-known techniques can help you build your own faster.

We are going to start with <<Sorting Algorithms>>
//  and searching algorithms,
then you are going to learn some techniques for solving problems.


.We are going to discuss the following approaches for solving algorithms problems:
- <<Greedy Algorithms>>: makes greedy choices using heuristics to find the best solution without looking back.
- <<Dynamic Programming>>: technique for solving problems with _overlapping subproblems_. It uses _memoization_ to avoid duplicated work.
- <<Divide and Conquer>>: _divide_ problems into smaller pieces, _conquer_ each subproblem and then _join_ the results.
- <<Backtracking>>: search _all (or some)_ possible paths. However it stops and _go back_ as soon as some contraint is broken.
- _Brute Force_: generate all possible solutions. (Use it as the last resort or as starting point to optimize it with other techniques).
