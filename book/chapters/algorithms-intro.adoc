In this 2nd part of the book we are going to cover algorithms in more details.
We are going to start with sorting and searching algorithms, then you are going to learn some techniques for solving problems.

IMPORTANT: There's not a single approach to solve all problems but knowing well-known techniques can help you build your own faster.

.We are going to discuss the following approaches for solving algorithms problems:
- <<Greedy Algorithms>>: makes choices at each step trying to find the optimal solution.
- <<Dynamic Programming>>: use memoization for repated subproblems.
- <<Backtracking>>: search all possible combinations until it finds the solution.
- <<Divide and conquer>>: break problems into smaller pieces and then join the results.
