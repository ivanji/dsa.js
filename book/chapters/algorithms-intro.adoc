In this 2nd part of the book we are going to cover algorithms in more details.
We are going to start with sorting and searching algorithms, then you are going to learn some techniques for solving problems.

IMPORTANT: There's not a single approach to solve all problems but knowing well-known techniques can help you build your own faster.

.We are going to discuss the following approaches for solving algorithms problems:
- <<Greedy Algorithms>>: makes greedy choices using heuristics to find the best solution without looking back.
- <<Dynamic Programming>>: technique for solving problems with *overlapping subproblems*. It uses *memoization* to avoid duplicated work.
- <<Divide and conquer>>: *divide* problems into smaller pieces, *conquer* each subproblem and then *join* the results.
- <<Backtracking>>: search all possible combinations until it finds the solution.
