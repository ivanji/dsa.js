= TreeMap

A TreeMap is a Map implementation using Binary Search Trees.

Implementing a Map with a tree, TreeMap, has a couple of advantages over a HashMap:

* Keys are always sorted.
* Statistical data can be easily obtained like the median, highest, lowest key.
* Collisions are not a concern so in the worst case is still *O(log n)*.
* Trees are more space efficient and don’t need to allocate memory beforehand (e.g. `HashMap`’s initial capacity) nor you have to rehash when is getting full.

Ok, now that you know the advantages, let’s implement it!
For a full comparison read the <<HashMap vs TreeMap>> section.

Let’s get started with the essential functions. They have the same interface as the `HashMap` (but the implementation is different).

.TreeMap class overview
[source, javascript]
----
class TreeMap {
  constructor(){}
  set(key, value) {}
  get(key) {}
  has(key) {}
  delete(key) {}
}
----

== Inserting values into a TreeMap

For inserting a value on a TreeMap, we first need to inialize the tree:

.TreeMap constructor
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/maps/tree-maps/tree-map.js[tag=constructor, indent=0]
----

The tree can be an instance of any Binary Search Tree that we implemented so far. However, for better performance, it should be a self-balanced tree like a https://github.com/amejiarosario/algorithms.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/red-black-tree.js[Red-Black Tree] or https://github.com/amejiarosario/algorithms.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/avl-tree.js[AVL Tree].


Let's implement the method to add values to the tree.

.TreeMap `add` method and `size` attribute
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/maps/tree-maps/tree-map.js[tag=set, indent=0]
----

Adding values is very easy (once we have the underlying tree implementation).

== Getting values out of a TreeMap

When We search by key in a tree map, it takes *O(log n)*. This is the implementation:

.TreeMap `get` and `has` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/maps/tree-maps/tree-map.js[tag=get, indent=0]
----

One side effect of storing keys in a tree is that they don't come up in insertion order. Instead, they ordered by value.

.TreeMap iterators
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/maps/tree-maps/tree-map.js[tag=iterators, indent=0]
----
<1> We implemented the default iterator using the in-order traversal. That's useful for getting the keys sorted.

.JavaScript Iterators and Generators
****
Generators are useful for producing values that can you can iterate in a `for...of` loop. Generators use the `function*` syntax which expects to have a `yield` with a value.
****

== Deleting values from a TreeMap

Removing elements from TreeMap is simple.

.TreeMap `delete` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/maps/tree-maps/tree-map.js[tag=delete, indent=0]
----

The BST implementation does all the heavy lifting.
