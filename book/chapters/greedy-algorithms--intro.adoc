Greedy algorithms are designed to find solution by going one step at time and using heuristics to determine the best choice.
They are quick but not always lead to most optimum results since it might not take into consideration all the options to give a solution.

A good example of a greedy algorithms that doesn't work well is finding the largest sum on a tree.

[graphviz, Find largest sum, svg]
....
graph G {
  5 -- 3 [color="#B8E986", penwidth=2]
  5 -- 7 [color="#FF5252", penwidth=2]
  3 -- 87 [color="#B8E986", penwidth=2]
  3 -- 1
  7 -- 2
  7 -- 4 [color="#FF5252", penwidth=2]

  label="Optimal vs. Greedy path"
}
....

The greedy algorithm will start at the root and say "Which number is bigger 3 or 7?" Then go with 7 and later 4. As you can see in the diagram, the largest sum would be the path `7 - 3 - 87`. A greedy algorithm never go back on it's options. This makes it different from dynamic programming which exhaustive and it's gurantee to find the best option.

Greedy algorithms are well suited when a local optimal solution is also a global optimal solution.

[TIP]
====
Greedy algorithms makes the choice that looks best in the moment based on a heuristic such as smallest, largest, best ratio, and so on.
This algorithm only give one shot at finding the solution and never goes back to consider other options.

Don't get the wrong idea some greedy algorithms works very well if they are designed correctly.

.Some examples greedy algorithms that works well:
- <<Selection Sort>>: we select the best (minimum value) remove it from the input and then select the next minimum until everything is processed.
- <<Merge Sort>>: the "merge" uses a greedy algorithm, where it combine two sorted arrays by looking at their current values and choosing the best (minimum) at every time.


.In general, we can follow these steps to design Greedy Algorithms:
1. Take a sample from the input data (usually in a data structure like array/list, tree, graph).
2. Greedy choice: use a heuristic function that will choose the best candidate. E.g., Largest/smallest number, best ratio, etc.
3. Reduce the processed input and pepeat step #1 and #2 until all data is gone.
4. Return solution.
5. Check correctness with different examples and edge cases.
