= Merge Sort

Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses "divide and conquer" paradigm to accomplish it task faster. It uses auxiliary memory in the process of sorting.

Merge sort algorithm splits the array in halves until 2 or less elements are left. It sorts these two elements and then merge back all halves until the whole array is sorted.

== Merge Sort Implementation

Merge sort implementation is as follows

.Merge Sort Algorithm
. It moves one element at a time (from left to right). Everything on the left of the current element is already sorted, while everything to the right is not.
. Start with the first element and make it the current element.
. Compare elements to right of the current element.
. Merge up big values to the right of the array.
.. Swap elements if the previous element is bigger than the previous one.
. Move the current pointer to the next element and repeat for the rest of the array


Let's convert these words into code!

.Merge Sort implementation in JavaScript (mergeSort)
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort.js[tag=sort, indent=0]
----
<1> Convert any kind of iterable (array, sets, etc.) into an array

As you can see this function is just a wrapper to transform things to array. The heavy lifting is done in `splitSort` as you can see below.

.Merge Sort implementation in JavaScript (splitSort)
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort.js[tag=splitSort, indent=0]
----
<1> Recursively divide the array in half until two or less elements are left.
<2> Sort two or less elements.
<3> Merge back the sorted halves in ascending order.

Let's now take a look at the merge function:

.Merge Sort implementation in JavaScript (merge)
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort.js[tag=merge, indent=0]
----
<1> We need to keep track of 3 arrays indices (mergedArray, a1 and a2).
<2> If `array1` has the lowest current value, we insert it into the merged array if not we then insert `array2`.
<3> End result is array1 and array2 combined in ascending order (sorted).

Merge sort has a _O(n log n)_  running time. For more details about the how to extract the runtime go to <<Linearithmic>>.

== Merge Sort Properties

- Time Complexity: [big]#✅# <<Linearithmic>> _O(n log n)_
- Space Complexity: [big]#⚠️# <<Linear>> _O(n)_
- <<Stable>>: [big]#✅# Yes
- <<In-place>>: [big]#⛔️️️️️# No, it requires auxiliary memory O(n).
- <<Online>>: [big]#️️️️️️️⛔️️️️️# No, new elements will require to sort the whole array.
- <<Adaptive>>: [big]#️️️️️️️⛔️️️️️# No, mostly sorted array takes the same time O(n log n).
- Recursive: Yes
