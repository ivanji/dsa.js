Dynamic programming (dp) is a way to solve algorithmic problems with *overlapping subproblems*. Algorithms using dp find the base case and building a solution from the ground-up. They also _keep track_ of previous answers to avoid re-computing the same operations.

.How to explain dynamic programming to kids? ðŸ‘¶
****

$$*$$*_Write down 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1_*$$*$$

--{sp} What's that equal to?

--{sp} $$*$$*_Kid counting one by one_*$$*$$ Ten!

--{sp} Add another "+1". What's the total now?

--{sp} $$*$$*_Quickly_*$$*$$  Eleven!

--{sp} Why you get the result so quickly? Ah, you got it faster by adding one to the memorized previous result. So Dynamic Programming is a fancy way of saying: "remembering past results to save time later"
