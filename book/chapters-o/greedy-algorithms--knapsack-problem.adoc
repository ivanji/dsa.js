= Fractional Knapsack Problem

We are going to use the "Fractional Knapsack Problem" to learn how to design greedy algorithms. The problem is the following:

> You are going to steal legumes (rice, beans, chickpeas, lentils) and you only brought a knapsack. What proportion of items can you choose to to get the highest loot without exceeding the maximum weight of the bag?

Let's say we have the following items available.

.Knpasack Input
[source, javascript]
----
const items = [
  { value: 1, weight: 1},
  { value: 4, weight: 3 },
  { value: 5, weight: 4 },
  { value: 7, weight: 5 },
];

const maxWeight = 7;
----

So, we have 4 items that we can take. We can't take them all because the total weight is `13` and the maximum we can carry is `7`. We can't just take the first one because with value `1` because obviosly is not the best profit.

How would you solve this problem?


First, we have to define what parameters are we going to use to make our *greedy choice*. This some ideas:

- We can take items with the *largest* value in hopes to get maximize profit. Based on that we can make take the last item and first having a total weight of 7 and total value of 8.

- Also, we could take items *smallest* weight so we can fit as much as possible. Let's analyze both options. So we can take the first 2 items for a total value of 5 and total weight of 4. This is worst! [big]#ðŸ‘Ž#

- One last idea, we can take items based on the *best* value/weight ratio and take fractions of an item to fill up the knapsack to maximum weight. In that case, we can take the last item and 2/3 of the 2nd item. We get a total value of `9.67` and total weight of `7`.

.Items value/weight ratio
----
  { value: 1, weight: 1 }, // 1/1  = 1
  { value: 4, weight: 3 }, // 4/3 = 1.33 âœ…
  { value: 5, weight: 4 }, // 5/4 = 1.25
  { value: 7, weight: 5 }, // 7/5 = 1.4 âœ…

Let's implement this algorithm!

What's the runtime of this algorithm?

We have to sort the array based on value/weight ratio. Sorting runtime is O(n log n). The rest is linear operations, so we the answer is _O(n log n)_ for our greedy algorithm.
